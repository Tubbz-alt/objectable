Package: objectable
Title: Create "Object Tables" with R Functions
Description: Experiment with object tables using pure R code. Object tables
    allow you to create custom environment that respond to `get()`, `ls()`,
    `assign()`, and `rm()` in any way you choose. This package is designed
    for rapid prototyping: rather than using this package in production,
    you should write your own C code to ensure optimal performance.
